# Pynocular

A consistant and pythonic way to handle different datasaets and translations between them.
A dataset can be a simple pandas datafrane or other colum/row data, or it can be data on a grid.

The key feature of pynocular is seamless translations from data represenation into any other. See `notebooks/example.ipynb`

Convenience `pyplot` plotting functions are also defined, in order to produce standard plots without the hassle of figuring out the correct input to the standard matplotlib functions.
